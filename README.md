# ToDo_List

This is a simple to-do list web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove tasks. The tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

- **Persistent Storage**: The to-do list is saved in the browser's local storage, so it will remain even if the page is reloaded.
